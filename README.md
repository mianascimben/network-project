## Overview 
This repository hosts the implementation of a python code useful for analysing how attacks and errors on netwroks may affect information and epidemic spreading. 


## Prerequisites

In ['requirements.txt'](url) there is a list of all the libraries needed to run the package properly.

## Installation

Python version supported : ![Python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8|3.9|3.10|3.11-blue.svg)

1. Clone the 'network-project' repository in from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mianascimben/network-project
```

2. Enter the directory of the cloned package:
```bash
cd network-project
```

3. If necessary install the requirements by using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the installation command using ['setup.py'](url). This will install the package and its dependencies in your Python environment:
```bash
python setup.py install
```


## Usage
The programm can be used through python script.

# Python 
In the sections ['how-to-guide'](url) there is a list of examples that will guide you in recreate the same simulations and analysis showed in the ['report'](url) In particular, one file is about simulating error/attack on netwroks and visualising the changes in graph feature; the other one focuses on simulating an epidemic and investigating on how nodes removing affects its spreading through analyzing different epidemic features.
